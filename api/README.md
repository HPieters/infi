# Keep Talking and Everybody Codes - API

API for the Keep Talking and Everybody Codes from Infi. Will serve the data from the csv in `../shared/data/cameras-defb.csv` for the `webapplication` to consume. Very simple implementation based on fastify.

## Getting started

1. Have Node.js installed on your system, see .nvmrc for the version. Recommended to use either [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions on your machine.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Ensure you have installed the dependancies in the `shared` folder as well (../shared).
4. Run the server: `npm start`

## Exercise

Serve the data through a Web-API, such that a web application can fetch the data.
